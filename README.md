# STM32F4xx-Drivers
Peripherals Drivers
I developed this drivers while studying a course called Master Microcontroller and Embedded Driver Development 1
course link: https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-microcontroller-with-peripheral-driver-development/learn/lecture/17154260?start=75#overview

1- I created drivers STM32F446RE MCU which is GPIO - I2C - SPI - UART - RCC.
2- I created microcontroller specific header file stm32f446xx.h.
3- I developed some applications to test and debug my drivers.

Soon I will provide other APIs for using Timers, PLLs, PWM, CAN, WFE/WFI, RTC to this repository...
